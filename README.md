# LearningCPP

This is my first repository where you can find some projects of mine in C++. It is devided into three folders such as:

1. Simple aplications.
2. Flashcards.
3. Leetcode.

## Simple aplications

There are programs base on common interview questions. I wrote them at the begining of my programming training course as those are short and concise problems.

## Flashcards

In this folder there is a complete own C++ aplication from scratch, which helps with **learning new words** in foreign language. The idea of the program showed up during reading an english book using Kindle. Kindle collects words that you don't know. Using that I transformed the file adding translations. After that I created three games and learning mode. Each one is differend and helps with remembering new words. The list of words is changing because after choosing the word that is already known it is not showing again. Hope you will like it.

## Leetcode

The last folder consists of small exercises that I found on Leedcode platform. Numeration of files is the same as you can find on side in order to easily find the problem.
